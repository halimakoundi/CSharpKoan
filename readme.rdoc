= DotNet Koans

This is a fork of the DotNet Koans that Cory Foy made.

The DotNet Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn .NET. The goal is to learn C#, the syntax, structure and some common functions and libraries. 

The DotNet Koans came about because of the most enlightened RubyKoans (http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans) and follow the structure of it most closely.

To use these Koans:
1. open the CSharp solution (CSharp.sln)
